I am an assistant professor (E&R lecturer) at the University of Exeter and at the Land, Economics, Environment and Policy Institute (LEEP). I work at the nexus of environmental, development and mathematical economics. 

My current research studies the drivers of deforestation and the economic impact of endemic diseases, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. I also study natural resource management under the threat of regime shifts and natural catastrophes. Additionally, I work on probability theory and stochastic analysis, with a focus on nonlinear diffusion processes. I am a classical pianist.
