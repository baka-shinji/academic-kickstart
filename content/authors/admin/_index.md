I am a visiting scholar at Cambridge University, UK, and principal investigator for the project "Schistosomiasis, Agriculture and Migration in Africa: a joint Economic and Ecological Approach" funded by the Swiss Network of International Studies. My current research studies the economic impact of endemic diseases, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, I work in mathematical economics, especially on applications of stochastic analysis and control to development, health and environmental economics. I am a classical pianist.
