Hailed as “a pianist of extraordinary dramatic flair” (The New York Times), “a memorable artist… of remarkable maturity and imagination” (El Paìs), the Italian pianist Daniele Rinaldo has already performed as soloist in major venues and festivals all over the world, such as “Rising Stars” in Alice Tully Hall and Chelsea Music Festival in New York, Lorin Maazel’s Castleton Festival in the USA, Wigmore Hall, St-Martin-in-the-Fields and Barbican in London, Tonhalle in Zurich, Konzerthaus in Berlin and in the main halls of Paris, Basel, Tokyo, Geneva and Rome, as well as touring extensively Europe, Japan, China and South America. 

He performed as soloist with orchestras such as Sinfonieorchester Basel, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Philharmonia Orchestra, Orchestra Filarmonica Italiana, Orchestra Nazionale della RAI, Real Filarmonica de Galicia, Orquesta Nacional de España, Orquesta Nacional de l’Ecuador and Orchestra del Teatro La Fenice under the baton of conductors such as Kurt Masur, Ken-David Masur, Howard Shelley, Lahav Shani, Fabio Luisi, Juanjo Mena, Kazuki Yamada. He was a prizewinner in international competitions such as Paloma O'Shea in Santander, Cleveland, Barcelona, Cagliari and more, and was the recipient of the prestigious Tunnell Trust and Kirckman Prizes in London.  Very active also as a chamber musician, he performed with the Hagen, Arditti and Casals String Quartets, as well as collaborating regularly with ensembles from duo to sextet. He recorded for Rai, Velut Luna, Guild and Heritage, and his upcoming release as soloist includes the complete Debussy Études together with works by Kurtág, Scriabin, Nono and Adès. 

He received his musical education at the Royal Academy of Music in London and at the Accademia Nazionale Santa Cecilia in Rome, and earlier at the Padua and the New England Conservatories. Most recently he obtained the Artist Diploma at the Musik-Akademie in Basel, under the guidance of Claudio Martínez Mehner. He is currently mentored by Maria João Pires.

He currently lives in Lausanne, Switzerland, loves the mountains and occasionally dabbles in electronic music.
