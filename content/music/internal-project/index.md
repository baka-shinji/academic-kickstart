Hailed as “a pianist of extraordinary dramatic flair” (The New York Times), “a memorable artist… of remarkable maturity and imagination” (El Paìs), the Italian pianist Daniele Rinaldo has already performed as soloist in major venues and festivals all over the world, such as “Rising Stars” in Alice Tully Hall and Chelsea Music Festival in New York, Lorin Maazel’s Castleton Festival in the USA, Wigmore Hall, St-Martin-in-the-Fields and Barbican in London, Tonhalle in Zurich, Verbier Festival, Konzerthaus in Berlin and in the main halls of Paris, Basel, Tokyo, Geneva and Rome, as well as touring extensively Europe, Japan, China and South America. 

He performed as soloist with orchestras such as Sinfonieorchester Basel, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Philharmonia Orchestra, Orchestra Filarmonica Italiana, Orchestra Nazionale della RAI, Real Filarmonica de Galicia, Orquesta Nacional de España, Orquesta Nacional de l’Ecuador and Orchestra del Teatro La Fenice under the baton of conductors such as Kurt Masur, Ken-David Masur, Lahav Shani, Howard Shelley, Juanjo Mena, Kazuki Yamada. He was a prizewinner in international competitions such as Paloma O'Shea in Santander, Cleveland, Barcelona, Cagliari and others, and was the recipient of the prestigious Tunnell Trust and Kirckman Prizes in London.  Very active also as a chamber musician, he performs regularly with ensembles such as the Hagen, Arditti and Casals String Quartets, as well as many prominent instrumentalists, and recorded for Velut Luna, Guild, Heritage, BBC and Rai. 

He received his musical education at the Royal Academy of Music in London, at the Accademia Nazionale Santa Cecilia in Rome, at the Musik-Akademie in Basel where he obtained the Soloist Diploma, and earlier at the Padua and the New England Conservatories. A pivotal figure in his artistic development through the last years has been Maria João Pires, who mentors him still today and with whom he frequently shares the concert stage. In addition to his musical career, he holds degrees in mathematics and economics from the University of Padua, as well as a doctorate from IHEID in Geneva. After a period at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Cambridge, he is currently a professor at the University of Exeter working at the nexus of environmental, development and mathematical economics.
